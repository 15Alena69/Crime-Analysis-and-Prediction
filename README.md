# Crime-Analysis-and-Prediction
Machine Learning Project

The dataset I have selected for this project contains crime records from Los Angeles spanning from 2020 onwards. It comprises over 800,000 rows and 28 columns, making it a valuable resource for analyzing crime hotspots, targeted victims, and frequently occurring crimes. The primary focus of my machine learning project is to predict the outcome of crimes, particularly whether the criminals get caught or not. This predictive model also aids authorities in generating leads for ongoing cases, prioritizing cases effectively, and delivering justice to victims. Ultimately, these efforts contribute to reducing the crime rate in the community.
